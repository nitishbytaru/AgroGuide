0,Pepper: Bell Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial spot is a serious disease affecting pepper and bell pepper crops, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. It leads to dark, water-soaked spots on leaves and fruits, which can reduce yield and market quality. For farmers, this disease is a major concern as it spreads quickly, especially in warm, wet conditions, often resulting in significant crop loss. Managing bacterial spot requires careful field hygiene, resistant varieties, and proper chemical treatments, all of which add to the cost and effort for small-scale growers.","To avoid bacterial spot in pepper and bell pepper crops, farmers should start by using disease-resistant seed varieties and certified pathogen-free transplants. Practicing crop rotation and avoiding overhead irrigation can help reduce the spread of bacteria. It's important to maintain good field hygiene by removing infected plant debris and weeds. Applying copper-based bactericides early and regularly during the growing season can also help manage the disease. With these preventive steps, farmers can protect their crops and reduce the risk of major losses.",https://csassets.static.wvu.edu/o2gpsy/50d2bf3d-125f-4b45-9c03-487959bd8344/0862b40bec913b574f1f05f79f2805c7/figure-2-tattered%20appearance%20on%20the%20affected%20leaves-893x595.jpg
1,Pepper: Bell Healthy,"Healthy bell pepper plants are vibrant, with strong green leaves, firm stems, and well-formed fruits. They thrive in warm, sunny conditions with well-drained soil rich in nutrients. A healthy plant is less vulnerable to pests and diseases and produces high yields of flavorful, brightly colored peppers. With proper care—like regular watering, mulching, and balanced fertilization—bell peppers can grow vigorously, benefiting farmers with better quality produce and improved market value.","Remove the cankers by pruning at least 15 inches below the end and burn or bury them. Also take preventative care with new season prunings and burn them, too.You are better off pruning during the dormant season. This will minimize the odds that fire blight will infect your tree and produce dead tissue that can easily be infected by Botryosphaeria.You should also take precautions if the bark is damaged by hail, or branches break during a windstorm. Using a copper-based fungicide will protect against both black rot and fire blight.",http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg
2,Potato : Early Blight,"Early blight is a common fungal disease in potatoes caused by Alternaria solani.
