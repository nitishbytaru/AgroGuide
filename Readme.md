# Project: Argoguide

Argoguide is a farmer's assistance web application designed to provide several key features using machine learning and web technologies.

## Features

1. **Plant Disease Detection**
   - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify diseases affecting crops based on uploaded images.

2. **Best Crop Suggestion**
   - Recommends the most suitable crops for cultivation based on various factors such as soil type, climate, and historical data.

3. **Yield Prediction**
   - Predicts crop yields using a random forest model trained on historical yield data and environmental factors.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Developed using Flask, a Python web framework. It handles data processing, machine learning model integration, and API endpoints for frontend communication.
  
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js, providing a responsive and interactive user interface for farmers to interact with the features seamlessly.

## Machine Learning Model

- **Random Forest Model**: Used for both yield prediction and crop suggestion functionalities. It leverages historical data and environmental parameters to make predictions.

## Overview

Argoguide integrates advanced machine learning capabilities with a user-friendly web interface to empower farmers with crucial insights into crop health, optimal crop selection, and yield forecasting. By combining Flask for robust backend operations and React.js for dynamic frontend interactions, the platform ensures efficient data processing and intuitive user experience.
